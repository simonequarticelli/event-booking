<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

### Event Viewing
Users can browse a list of events, sorted by date. For each event, information about the location, date and time, event description, availability and ticket prices are displayed.

![img.png](images/img.png)

__Bonus:__
Each event will have three types of seats type of seat _standard_, _premium_, _gold_. Depending on the type chosen the price will be different.

### Seat Booking
The user can select the types of seats per event and proceed with the booking.<br />
![img_2.png](images/img_2.png)<br />
At the time of the booking request, some checks will be made to validate the request. ex. on the availability of places and the type requested.<br />
![img_4.png](images/img_4.png)

### Checkout and Payment
After selecting seats (even on multiple events), the user proceeds to checkout. The app randomly misses a confirmation/decline email to the user with the details of their purchase.<br />
#### Response example
![img_3.png](images/img_3.png)<br />
![img_5.png](images/img_5.png)<br />
#### Email example
![img_6.png](images/img_6.png)
### User Account Management
Users can create an account, log in and log out. The user profile maintains a record of the user's past and future bookings.

___

### Additional features
- The reservation was planned with the concept of shopping cart
- There is only one active transaction per user at a time 
- If an active transaction already exists for the user and he executes another request it is powered
- Writing logs in case of error
- Created a FilterableByDatas trait to do statistics on transactions
- When a transaction is rejected, the related booked tickets are cancelled

### Technical concepts
- Events
- Listeners
- Services
- Resources response
- Pagination response
- Computed property on model (ticket_available)
- DB trasaction for data integrity

### TODO

- [ ] Reservation expired
- [ ] Sync shopping cart
- [ ] Discount on events
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Repository pattern

### API list 
- auth
  - login
  - register
  - logout
  - me

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
#### Docker
- __For Mac:__
  - Download Docker Desktop for Mac from the Docker Hub website at ðŸ‘‰ [this link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).
  - Once the Docker.dmg file is downloaded, open it.
  - Drag and drop the Docker app onto the Applications folder in the opened window.
  - Open the Docker app from the Applications folder. You may be asked to provide your system password for the installer to make changes.
  - Wait for the Docker Desktop to notify you that it's ready. It'll appear as a whale icon in your top menu bar.
  
- __For Windows:__
  - Download Docker Desktop for Windows from the Docker Hub website at ðŸ‘‰ [this link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
  - Once the Docker Desktop Installer.exe is downloaded, run it.
  - In the installation wizard, ensure the "Enable Hyper-V Windows Features" or "Install required Windows components for WSL 2" option is selected and proceed with the installation.
  - When the installation completes, the Docker Desktop application launches automatically.
  - Wait until the Docker Desktop app displays a whale icon in the notification area, indicating that Docker is up and running.


For both Mac and Windows, after installing Docker Desktop, you can verify the installation by opening a terminal window and typing the following command:
    
```sh
docker --version
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/simonequarticelli/event-booking.git
   ```
2. Move into project folder
   ```sh
    cd event-booking
   ```
3. install prerequisites (composer and php)
   ```sh
   ./prerequisites.sh
   ```
4. Run docker container
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```
5. Create database
   - For convenience I use a sqlite. To set it, modify the following variables by environment like this 
     ```sh
      DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
      #DB_CONNECTION=mysql
      #DB_HOST=mysql
      #DB_PORT=3306
      #DB_DATABASE=event_booking
      #DB_USERNAME=sail
      #DB_PASSWORD=password
      ```
   - And lunch 
      ```sh
      php artisan migrate
      ```
6. Seeding
   ```sh
   php artisan db:seed
   ```
7. To send emails locally, modify the following environment variables. A service that could work well ðŸ‘‰ [link](https://mailtrap.io/) 
   ```sh
    MAIL_MAILER=smtp
    MAIL_HOST=mailpit
    MAIL_PORT=1025
    MAIL_USERNAME=null
    MAIL_PASSWORD=null
    MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
    MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@example.com"
    MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
   ```
<br />
<br />

If you want to export postman collection ðŸ‘‰ [link](https://github.com/andreaselia/laravel-api-to-postman)
   ```sh
   php artisan export:postman 
   ```
